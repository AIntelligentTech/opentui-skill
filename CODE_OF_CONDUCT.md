# Code of Conduct

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-24
---

This project follows a simple, community-friendly Code of Conduct inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- Age, body size, visible or invisible disability
- Ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression
- Level of experience, education, socio-economic status
- Nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation

We commit to acting and interacting in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and may ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Prefer private contact with the maintainers (e.g., via the repository security/contact mechanism once hosted), or
- If that is not available, open a minimally-detailed issue indicating a Code of Conduct concern and a maintainer will follow up privately.

Please include as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing so maintainers can investigate and respond appropriately.

## Enforcement

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Depending on severity and context, enforcement actions may range from a warning to temporary or permanent bans from project spaces.
